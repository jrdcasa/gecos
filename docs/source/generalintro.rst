General introduction
====================

GeCos (GEneration of COnformers) is a python library to quickly generate conformers of small molecules.

Features included:

 - Wide molecule formats are supported, including ``pdb``, ``mol2``, ``xyz`` and more.
 - Generate conformers using the ETKDG algorithm [#]_ implemented in rdkit [#]_.
 - Generate conformers using the ConFab algorithm implemented in openbabel.
