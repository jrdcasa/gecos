Extracting the archive file before running the R.E.D. Server Dev./PyRED job: 
You uploaded an archive file. The input files for R.E.D. Server Development were extracted with success. 


Checking the input files before running the R.E.D. Server Dev./PyRED job: 
The maximum number of atoms for a molecule/conformation in a PDB input file handled by R.E.D. Server Dev./PyRED is set to 250 atoms. For the reasons of this choice read http://q4md-forcefieldtools.org/REDServer-Development/faq.php#17 
The maximal number of atoms is correct. 


No problem to report in this R.E.D. Server Dev./PyRED job.
