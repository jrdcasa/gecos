 Save ./Project.config into ./Project.config-ArchiveFile
 ./System.config file found
 Save ./System.config into ./System.config-ArchiveFile
 ./frcmod.user file found
 Save ./frcmod.user into ./frcmod.user-ArchiveFile

 Check the presence of the Mol_red$n.pdb input files in the Archive file:
 Single ./Mol_red1.pdb input file found in the working directory

 Check the presence of the Mol_red$n.out/.log & Mol_red$n-$i.out/.log QM files in the Archive file:
 WARNING: No QM Mol_red$n.out/.log & Mol_red$n-$i.out/.log QM file found

 Check the presence of the Data-R.E.D.Server directory in the Archive file:
 WARNING: No Data-R.E.D.Server directory found

 The conformations in a PDB input file must have the same atom order
 The conformations in the QM files must have the same atom order
 The atom order in the PDB and QM files must be identical

 → PDB input file: ./Mol_red1.pdb
 Save ./Mol_red1.pdb into ./Mol_red1.pdb-ArchiveFile
 Check the format and the ATOM, HETATM, MODEL, ENDMDL, TER & CONECT keywords of Mol_red1.pdb
 Modify this file according to the PDB file format and remove the CRLF characters if needed
 The number of atoms of Mol_red1.pdb is below the defined threshold (250 atoms): ok
 Check the number of atoms for the 20 conformation(s) of Mol_red1.pdb
 Mol_red1.pdb - Conformation No = 20 - Atoms per conformation = 50
 • Check the Mol_red1.pdb PDB input file:
   Check the Elements & Compare the Atom Order in the 20 conformations:
 ◦  Elements & Atom order OK
 • Check the QM file(s):
   QM file = WARNING QM_file_not_found - Conf. no 1
   QM file = WARNING QM_file_not_found - Conf. no 2
   QM file = WARNING QM_file_not_found - Conf. no 3

 List the PDB file(s) found in the working directory:
 ./Mol_red1.pdb
 1 PDB file(s) found in the working directory
 ./Mol_red1.pdb
 1 Mol_red$n.pdb PDB file(s) found in the working directory
 ./Mol_red1.pdb
 1 consecutive Mol_red$n.pdb PDB input file(s) found in the working directory

 The Mol_red$n.pdb PDB file number & consecutive PDB input file number are identical:
   The Mol_red1.pdb file is the only PDB input file used in this job

 The number of atoms of the Mol_red1.pdb input file is below the defined threshold (250 atoms): ok

 Check and correct the keywords in the 'Project.config' and 'System.config' files:
 . 'System.config' file found in the working directory:
 Remove empty lines and CRLF, special & missplaced space characters, homogenize the comments, and format the file
 . 'Project.config' file found in the working directory:
 Remove empty lines and CRLF, special & missplaced space characters, homogenize the comments, and format the file
 Check and correct the 'frcmod.user' file:
 Remove the CRLF characters, replace a tabulation by space characters, remove lines that start by the '# !' character

 Add keywords chosen by the user during the submission procedure or defined by the PBS script in the System.config file

 Analysis of the 'System.config' file used in the current PyRED job:
 Default option: OPT_Calc = ON - The geometry optimization step is carried out with default criteria
 Default option: MEPCHR_Calc = ON - The MEP computation and charge derivation/force field generation steps are carried out
 Default option: Freq_Calc = OFF - The frequencies computation step is not requested
   (This step is useful to determine the nature of the stationary point found during the geometry optimization step)
 Default option: Re_Fit = OFF - The re-generation of the force field from QM data is not requested

 The geometry optimization step is requested in the System.config file
 Correct PDB input file(s) found with compatible atom orders
 20 QM file(s) is/are missing
 Let's run PyRED as the QM file(s) is/are not demanded...

 A WARNING message is only informative for the user: the PyRED job is executed
 When an ERROR message is generated the PyRED job is not executed
