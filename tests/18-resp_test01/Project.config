!! In a PyRED job, which involves multiple orientations multiple conformations
!!   and/or multiple molecules:
!!   - '$n' is the molecule index involving multiple molecules
!!   - each molecule can contain '$i' conformation(s)
!!   - each conformation can be involved in a '$j' reorientation(s) procedure
!!  '$n', '$i' and '$j' are integers, which are strickly greater than '0'.
!!
!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!        Molecule keywords, which depend on the '$n' molecule index       !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!
!! The title of molecule '$n':
!! The MOLECULE'$n'-TOTCHARGE keyword allows defining an informative title for
!!   a molecule. If this keyword is not provided the MOLECULE-'$n' title is 
!!   assigned by default.
!! This tile is used to identify the molecule(s) involved in FF generation in
!!   the output files generated by PyRED
!! Do not use any blank character in the title, and replace the blank character
!!   by the underscore '_' character
!! The title of the Mol_red1.pdb input molecule is g+/g+_conformation_dimethylphosphate:
# MOLECULE1-TITLE         = g+/g+_conformation_dimethylphosphate
!! The title of the Mol_red2.pdb input molecule is Methanol:
# MOLECULE2-TITLE         = Methanol
# MOLECULE3-TITLE         = ...
!!
!! The total charge of molecule '$n':
!! The MOLECULE'$n'-TOTCHARGE keyword is required only if the total charge
!!   value of the molecule does not equal '0'. If this keyword is not provided, 
!!   0 is the total charge value assigned by default.
!! The molecule total charge can also be determined from the PDB input file, see:
!! https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/REDServer-Development/Documentation/readme.txt
!! The total charge of the Mol_red1.pdb input molecule is -1; this is an anion:
# MOLECULE1-TOTCHARGE    = -1
!! The total charge of the Mol_red2.pdb input molecule is 1; this is a cation:
# MOLECULE2-TOTCHARGE    = 1
# MOLECULE3-TOTCHARGE    = ...
!!
!! The spin multiplicity of molecule '$n':
!! The MOLECULE'$n'-SPINMULT keyword is required only if the spin multiplicity
!!   value of the molecule does not equal '1'. If this keyword is not provided, 
!!   1 is the spin multiplicity value assigned by default.
!! See the examples below to determine the spin multiplicity of a molecule
!! Spin multiplicity = 0 is not possible!
!! Set spin multiplicity = 1 for a molecule without single electron:
!!   (most of the cases for bioorganic molecules)
!! No single electron (unpaired) in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE1-SPINMULT     = 1
!! One single electron in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
!! Example Cu(II): nine electrons in the five d orbitals
!!              a single electron in the five d orbitals:
# MOLECULE2-SPINMULT     = 2
!! Two single electrons in the Mol_red3.pdb input file:
!! Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_oxygen .O-O.
# MOLECULE3-SPINMULT     = 3
!! Five single electrons in the Mol_red3.pdb input file: 
!! Example Fe(III): five single electrons in the five d orbitals:
!! See https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-4-demo21.pdf
# MOLECULE3-SPINMULT     = 6
!! No single electron in the Mol_red3.pdb input file:
!! Example Zn(II): ten paired electrons in the five d orbitals:
# MOLECULE3-SPINMULT     = 1
!!
!! The atoms of the '$n' input molecule(s) are automatically reordered so that 
!!   the hydrogen atoms are located after the heavy atom they are bound to
!! This option is usefull to make atom indexes more 'human understandable', 
!!   when keywords related to the input atom order have to be defined by the user
!!   (geometrical and/or charge constraints, atom typing, etc...): 
!!   In that case, one has to proceed in two steps: 
!! - a first job is executed, where the PDB input files are simply reordered 
!!   (atom indexes can be graphically determined in the dedicated JSmol applet 
!!   generated in each R.E.D.Server Development job)
!! - a second productive job is then run, where the reordered PDB input files 
!!   (i. e. the optimized PDB outputs from the previous job) associated with 
!!   keywords with more intuitive (and less error prone) atom indexes are 
!!   provided by the user
!! If not provided MOLECULE'$n'-ATMREORDR = ON is the default.
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-ATMREORDR = OFF the atom order provided in the PDB input 
!!   file is conserved.
!! Reorder the atoms of the Mol_red1.pdb input molecule according to the algorithm
!!   developed in PyRED:
# MOLECULE1-ATMREORDR    = ON
!! Do not reorder the atoms of the Mol_red2.pdb input molecule:
# MOLECULE2-ATMREORDR    = OFF
# MOLECULE3-ATMREORDR    = ...
!!
!! Automatically correct the atom names of molecule '$n' so that two atoms in 
!!   a residue cannot share the same name: indeed to be differentiated, two 
!!   atoms belonging to a residue cannot have the same name in a FF lib (.mol2
!!   file)
!! See https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-4.php#Bpol2 
!! If not provided MOLECULE'$n'-ATMCOR = ON1 is the default.
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-ATMCOR = ON1 only redundant atom names are renamed.
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-ATMCOR = ON2 all the atoms are renamed so that an atom name
!!   is composed by its element and an integer, that is incremented.
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-ATMCOR = OFF atom names are not corrected, even if
!!   duplicates are found (not recommended).
# MOLECULE1-ATMCOR       = ON1
# MOLECULE2-ATMCOR       = ON2
# MOLECULE3-ATMCOR       = ...
!!
!! Atom connectivities allow defining the molecular topology i. e. the single 
!!   bonds in the FF lib. (mol2 file), and are used in charge equivalencing and 
!!   charge derivation
!! Atom connectivities are automatically determined by PyRED from each optimized
!!   geometry: atom connectivities provided in the PDB input file through the 
!!   PDB CONECT keyword are not read by default
!! If not provided MOLECULE'$n'-CALCONECT = ON is the default.
!! Setting MOLECULE'$n'-CALCONECT = OFF, and providing the atom connectivities
!!   in the PDB input file with the CONECT keyword prevent automatic atom 
!!   connectivity determination. This approach is advantageous for bioinorganic 
!!   complexes (with a metal center), where long single bonds have to be defined
!!   See: https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-4.php#II4 
!! Using MOLECULE'$n'-CALCONECT = OFF is not recommended for organic molecules, 
!!   and is even error-prone: to be used with care
# MOLECULE1-CALCONECT    = ON
# MOLECULE2-CALCONECT    = OFF
# MOLECULE3-CALCONECT    = ...
!!
!! Chemical equivalencing used in the charge fitting step is automatically 
!!   determined for molecule '$n':
!! If not provided MOLECULE'$n'-CALCHEMEQ = ON is the default.
!! Set MOLECULE1-CALCHEMEQ = OFF to cancel chemical equivalencing (not 
!!   recommended).
# MOLECULE1-CALCHEMEQ    = ON
# MOLECULE2-CALCHEMEQ    = ON
# MOLECULE3-CALCHEMEQ    = ...
!!
!! Automatically correct the residue names of molecule '$n' in PyRED outputs:
!! Atoms are commonly grouped within a residue, and a residue name is generally
!!    composed by three (more rarely four) characters.
!! If not provided MOLECULE'$n'-RESMOD = ON is the default.
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-RESMOD = ON, a single residue name by molecule is generated,
!!   and atom names are corrected accordingly. The use of this keyword is 
!!   strongly advised: fundamentally, generating a FF lib. composed of different
!!   residues is correct, but the LEaP program from the Amber tools is only able
!!   to load FF lib. composed of a single residue, when one wants to get matches
!!   with a file obtained from the protein data bank:
!!   See https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-4.php#Bpol2 
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-RESMOD = OFF and if they are judged correct residue names 
!!   of molecule '$n' are conserved.
# MOLECULE1-RESMOD       = ON
# MOLECULE2-RESMOD       = OFF
# MOLECULE3-RESMOD       = ...
!!
!! Definition of the atom names of molecule '$n':
!! If this keyword is not provided the atom names are automatically determined
!!   from the PDB input file.
!! The atom name order in that keyword matters; it is that in the PDB input files:
!! The atom name order is that in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE1-ATMNAME      = C1 H11 H12 H13 O3' P O1P O2P O5' C2 H21 H22 H23
!!              (atom names for dimethylphosphate are taken as an example here)
!! The atom name order is that in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE2-ATMNAME      = C1 H11 H12 H13 OH HO
!!              (atom names for methanol are taken as an example here)
!!
!! Definition of the chemical elements of the atoms of molecule '$n'
!! If this keyword is not provided the elements are automatically determined
!!   from the PDB input file.
!! The element order in that keyword matters; it is that in the PDB input files:
!! The element order is that in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE1-ATMELME      = C H H H O P O O O C H H H
!!       (chemical elements of dimethylphosphate are taken as an example here)
!! The element order is that in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE2-ATMELME      = C H H H O H
!!       (chemical elements of methanol are taken as an example here)
!!
!! Definition of the atom types of molecule '$n':
!! Useful to modify the atom types automatically determined by PyRED, and/or to
!!   define new atom types: the atom types in a FF lib. (mol2 file) have to be 
!!   graphically checked in the dedicated JSmol applet generated in each R.E.D.
!!   Server Development job, and can be modified using this keyword in a new 
!!   PyRED job
!! When new atom types are defined, a 'frcmod.user' file can also be provided as 
!!   input to PyRED to provide the FF parameters related to these new atom types
!! If this keyword is not provided the atom types are automatically determined
!!   based on the dictionary of atom types developed in PyRED
!! The atom type order in that keyword matters; it is that in the PDB input files:
!! The atom type order is that in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
MOLECULE1-ATMTYPE      = CT HC HC HC CT HC HC OS CT HC HC CT HC HC OS CT HC HC CT HC HC OS CT HC HC CT HC HC S CT HC HC CT HC HC S CT HC HC CT HC HC S CT HC CH CT HC HC HC
!! The atom type order is that in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE2-ATMTYPE      = CT H1 H1 H1 OH HO
!! GAFF atom types can be used in association with the 'gaff.dat' file provided 
!!   as a 'frcmod.user' input file: 
# MOLECULE1-ATMTYPE      = c3 h1 h1 h1 os p5 o  o  os c3 h1 h1 h1
!!                (atom types of dimethylphosphate are taken as an example here)
# MOLECULE2-ATMTYPE      = c3 h1 h1 h1 oh ho
!!                (atom types of methanol are taken as an example here)
!! Atom types of other force fields can also be provided here: 
!! GAFF, GAFF2, Amber14FFSB, Amber19FFSB, GLYCAM 2006, OPLS...
!! See https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-4-demo5.pdf
!!     https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-4-demo6.pdf
!!
!! Forcing charge/chemical equivalencing of molecule '$n' for the charge fitting
!!   step carried out without intra-molecular charge constraint(s):
!! This is achived by providing atom names based on two empirical/basic rules:
!!   (i) atoms, which are chemically equivalent bear the same element and the 
!!   same integer,
!!   (ii) if one wants to recompute the charge values of atoms or groups of
!!   toms in the second resp stage (usually the charges of the methylene and
!!   methyl groups) the heavy atoms of these groups have to be underlined using 
!!   the '@' character.
!! Chemical/charge equivalencing (and charges values) in a FF lib. (mol2 file) 
!!   has to be graphically checked in the dedicated JSmol applet generated in 
!!   each R.E.D. Server Development job, and charge equivalencing can be 
!!   modified using this keyword in a new PyRED job
!! If not provided chemical equivalencing is automatically determined.
!! The atom order in that keyword matters; it is that in the PDB input files:
!! The atom order is that in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE1-CHEMEQSM     = C@1 H1 H1 H1 O1 P1 O2 O2 O1 C@1 H1 H1 H1
!!           (empirical rules for dimethylphosphate are taken as an example here)
!!           (dimethylphosphate: the two methyl groups are made equivalent)
!! The atom order is that in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE2-CHEMEQSM     = C@1 H1 H1 H1 O2 H2
!!           (empirical rules for methanol are taken as an example here)
!!
!! Forcing charge/chemical equivalencing of molecule '$n' for the charge fitting
!!   step carried out with intra-molecular charge constraint(s):
!! This is achived by providing specific atom names; see empirical rules above
!! If not provided chemical equivalencing is automatically determined.
!! This keyword is often required when using intra-molecular charge constraint
!!   and can be adapted from the MOLECULE'$n'-CHEMEQSM keyword printed in the 
!!   'Project-out.config' file obtained from a previous PyRED job (see the 
!!   'Data-Default-Proj' directory).
!! The atom order in that keyword matters; it is that in the PDB input files:
!! The atom order is that in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE1-CHEMEQIA     = C1 H2 H3 H4 O1 P1 O5 O5 O6 C@7 H7 H7 H7
!!             (dimethylphosphate: first methyl group involved in an INTRA-MCC1)
!! The atom order is that in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE2-CHEMEQIA     = C@1 H1 H1 H1 O2 H2
!!             (methanol: OH and HO atoms are involved in an INTRA-MCC1)
!!
!! Forcing charge/chemical equivalencing of molecule '$n' for the charge fitting
!!   step involving multiple molecules:
!! This is achived by providing specific atom names; see empirical rules above
!! If not provided chemical equivalencing is automatically determined.
!! This keyword is often required for the charge fitting step, which involves 
!!   multiple molecules, and can be adapted from the MOLECULE'$n'-CHEMEQSM keyword
!!   printed in the 'Project-out.config' file obtained from a previous PyRED job
!!   (see the 'Data-Default-Proj' directory).
!! The atom order in that keyword matters; it is that in the PDB input files:
!! The atom order is that in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE1-CHEMEQMM     = C1 H2 H3 H4 O5 P6 O7 O7 O8 C9 H10 H11 H12
!!             (dimethylphosphate: two methyl groups involved in two INTER-MCC1)
!! The atom order is that in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE2-CHEMEQMM     = C@1 H1 H1 H1 O2 H2
!!             (empirical rules for methanol are taken as an example here)
!!
!! The rigid body re-orientation algorithm (RBRA) is applied to each optimized
!!   geometry/conformation of molecule '$n' before MEP computation:
!! This allows deriving highly reproducible MEP-based charge values.
!!   see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918240/
!! Two sets of indexes for 3 non-linear atoms are automatically selected from 
!!   the center of mass of the molecule, and involved in the RBRA procedure.
!!   A '$j' = 2 molecular reorientation MEP-based computation is consequently 
!!   carried out (recommended). In that case the two set of indexes are chosen
!!   so that the impact of the first reorientation on the MEP is cancelled out
!!   by the second one.  
!! If not provided MOLECULE'$n'-RBRA = ON is the default.
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-RBRA = OFF the molecular orientation generated after 
!!   geometry optimization and defined by the QM program is directly involved 
!!   in MEP  computation. A '$j' = 1 MEP-based computation is carried out, 
!!   and leads to non-reproducible charge values (not recommended).
!!   see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918240/
# MOLECULE1-RBRA         = ON
# MOLECULE2-RBRA         = OFF
# MOLECULE3-RBRA         = ...
!!
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-RBRA = ON the procedure controlled using the MOLECULE'n'-
!!   REORIENT keyword allows managing reorientations (i.e. a translation
!!   and a series of rigid body rotations) for each optimized geometry/
!!   conformation of molecule '$n'.
!!   see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918240/
!! Set(s) of indexes for 3 non-linear atoms are defined in MOLECULE'n'-REORIENT
!!   and involved in the procedure.
!! If MOLECULE'n'-RBRA = ON and none of the three MOLECULE'n'-REORIENT, 
!!   MOLECULE'n'-ROTATE and MOLECULE'n'-TRANSLATE keywords is provided two
!!   sets of 3 non-linear atoms are automatically selected by PyRED (see 
!!   above; recommended).
!! Atom indexes are these in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
!! The optimized geometry, which is reoriented is Mol_m1/Mol_m1-c1-qmra.pdb
!! The optimized geometry of the Mol_red1.pdb input file is reoriented four times
!!   and four MEP are generated:
# MOLECULE1-REORIENT     = 1 2 3 | 3 2 1 | 1 6 10 | 10 6 1
!! Atom indexes are these in the Mol_red2.pdb input file:
!! The optimized geometry, which is reoriented is Mol_m2/Mol_m2-c1-qmra.pdb
!! The optimized geometry of the Mol_red2.pdb input file is reoriented twice 
!!   and two MEP are generated:
# MOLECULE2-REORIENT     = 1 2 3 | 3 2 1
!! Atom indexes are these in the Mol_red3.pdb input file:
# MOLECULE3-REORIENT     = ...
!!
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-RBRA = ON the procedure controlled using the MOLECULE'n'-
!!   ROTATE keyword allows managing rotations (i.e. a series of rigid body
!!   rotations) for each optimized geometry/conformation of molecule '$n'.
!! Set(s) of indexes for 3 non-linear atoms are defined in MOLECULE'n'-ROTATE
!!   and involved in the procedure.
!! Using the same indexes in MOLECULE'n'-ROTATE or in MOLECULE'n'-REORIENT
!!   leads to identical charge values.
!! If MOLECULE'n'-RBRA = ON and none of the three MOLECULE'n'-REORIENT, 
!!   MOLECULE'n'-ROTATE and MOLECULE'n'-TRANSLATE keywords is provided two
!!   sets of indexes for 3 non-linear atoms are automatically selected.
!! Atom indexes are these in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:
!! The optimized geometry, which is rotated is Mol_m1/Mol_m1-c1-qmra.pdb
!! The optimized geometry of the Mol_red1.pdb input file is rotated four times 
!!   and four MEP are generated:

# MOLECULE3-ROTATE       = ...
!!
!! If MOLECULE'$n'-RBRA = ON the procedure controlled using the MOLECULE'n'-
!!   TRANSLATE keyword allows managing translations carried out on the X, Y 
!!   and Z axes for each optimized geometry/conformation of molecule '$n'.
!! A translation results in different set of Cartesian coordinates used in 
!!   MEP computation, but does not affect charge values.
!! Set(s) of 3 distances are defined in the MOLECULE'n'-TRANSLATE keyword,
!!   and applied on the X, Y and Z axes.
!! If MOLECULE'n'-RBRA = ON and none of the three MOLECULE'n'-REORIENT, 
!!   MOLECULE'n'-ROTATE and MOLECULE'n'-TRANSLATE keywords is provided two
!!   sets of 3 non-linear atoms are automatically selected by PyRED
!! The optimized geometry, which is translated is Mol_m1/Mol_m1-c1-qmra.pdb:

!!   four times and four MEP are generated:
!!   - Add +1 to the X axis for the first translation

!!
!! Request the use of an intra-molecular charge constraint for molecule '$n'
!!   during the charge fitting step:
!! This allows constraining the charge value of an atom or a group of atoms 
!!   as well as generating molecular fragment(s) from molecule '$n'.
!!   see http://q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-3.php#16
!! The format to be used is the following: 
!!   Value of the constraint | atom indexes belonging to the constraint |
!!   R flag ('remove' the atoms involved in the constraint in the FF lib.)
!!   or K flag ('keep' the atoms involved in the constraint in the FF lib.)
!! INTRA-MCC1: the intra-molecular charge constraint is not repeated in the 
!!   second fitting stage (if any), and/or the charge values of chemically 
!!   equivalent atoms, that belong to the list of atoms involved in the 
!!   constraint, are not equivalenced. This leads to the use of a minimum 
!!   number of constraints during the charge fitting step: this is the 
!!   approach that was originally developed, and that one generally needs: 
!!   indeed, atoms involved in intra- molecular charge constraint are generally
!!   removed from the FF lib.: thus, they do not need to be equivalenced 
!!   (because not involved in molecular dynamics simulations).
!! INTRA-MCC2: the intra-molecular charge constraint is repeated in the second
!!   fitting stage (if any), and/or the charge values of chemically equivalent
!!   atoms, that belong to the list of atoms involved in the constraint, are 
!!   equivalenced. This approach uses additional constraints for the charge fit

!! Definition of geometrical constraints during geometry optimization:
!! Positional constraint: provide the atom index to be constrained (fixed).
!!   To be repeated for each atom to be constrained:
!! Atom indexes are these in the Mol_red1.pdb input file:

!! Important remarks:
!! Using a positional constraint for an atom is not possible in GAMESS or 
!!   Firefly.
!! When using Gaussian 03, Gaussian 09 A.02, GAMESS or Firefly bond, angle 
!!   and dihedral values are read. However, it is advised to provide 
!!   Cartesian coordinates close to the constrained value(s). This allows 
!!   faster convergence.
!! When using Gaussian 09 (ver C.01, D.01 or E.01) and Gaussian 16 (B.01, 
!!   C.01) bond, angle and dihedral values are not read. Thus, the user must
!!   provide Cartesian coordinates in agreement with the constrained value(s).
!!   Using a PDB input file with four digits after the decimal point increases
!!   the accuracy.
!! QM geometry optimization is performed without any geometrical constraint 
!!   by default.
!! Geometrical constraint(s) may be used during QM geometry optimization to
!!   prevent the formation of unwanted non-bonding interactions: indeed, 
!!   geometry optimization carried out in gas phase tends to overestimate 
!!   non-bonding interactions such as hydrogen-bonds or salt-bridges compared
!!   to a computation performed in condensed phases.

!! Request the use of an inter-molecular charge constraint between two
!!   different molecules involved in a multiple molecules job:
!! This allows generating molecular fragment(s) from two molecules.
!! See http://q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-3.php#17
!!     http://q4md-forcefieldtools.org/Tutorial/Tutorial-3.php#18 and

!! The format is the following:
!! Value of the constraint | two molecule indexes involved in this constraint
!! | atom indexes belonging to the first molecule involved in the constraint
!! | atom indexes belonging to the second molecule involved in the constraint
!! INTER-MCC1: the constraint is not repeated in the second fitting stage,
!!   and/or the charge values of chemically equivalent atoms, that belong to
!!   the list of atoms involved in the constraint, are not equivalenced.
!!   This leads to the use of a minimum number of constraints during the
!!   charge fitting step, and is the approach that was originally developed.
!! INTER-MCC2: the constraint is repeated in the second fitting stage and/or 
!!   the charge values of chemically equivalent atoms, that belong to the 
!!   list of atoms involved in the constraint, are equivalenced.
!! INTER-MCC1 vs INTER-MCC2: see the documentation above about INTRA-MCC1.
!! In case of doubt, just use INTER-MCC1.

!! Request the use of inter-molecular charge equivalencing between atoms 
!!   belonging to different molecules involved in a multiple molecules job:

!! Two formats are implemented: MOLECULE-INTER-MEQA and MOLECULE-INTER-MEQB:
!! Molecule indexes involved in the constraints | identical atom indexes 
!! belonging to all the molecules involved in the constraints
# MOLECULE-INTER-MEQA    = 2 3 4 5 | 1 2 3 4
!! No MOLECULE index in the 'MOLECULE-INTER-MEQA' keyword; molecule indexes are
!! provided in the first field of the keyword between the equal and pipe 
!! characters ('2 3 4 5' in the example above)

!! involved in the constraints separated by the '-' character

!!
!! Control of the radii of the [H - LR] elements to define the atom
